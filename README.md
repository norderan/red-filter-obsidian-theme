**A Blue-Light-Free Night Theme for Better Sleep (for OLED screens)**

Tired of screens disrupting your sleep? This theme is designed to help you wind down naturally by eliminating all blue light from your display.

**Features**

-   **Pure Red Interface:** Uses only pure reds, which don't produce any blue light.
-   **Red Image Filtering:** Applies a red-scale filter to all images, neutralizing blue light.
-   **True Black Background:** Leverages OLED's ability to turn pixels off completely, creating a true black that saves power and reduces glare.
-   **No Blue Light Emission:** Ensures that no blue light is produced, helping your brain's natural sleep cycle.

**How does it work?**

At night, exposure to blue light can trick your brain into delaying the production of melatonin, the hormone that tells your body it's time to sleep. We are surrounded by blue light from our phones, TVs, and artificial lighting, which can disrupt this natural process.

OLED displays have a unique advantage. Each pixel is composed of individual red, green, and a blue sub-pixel. This theme cleverly instructs your screen to only use the red sub-pixels while keeping the blue and green ones completely off. By combining pure red light with true black (where pixels are turned off), your screen emits zero blue light, allowing you to use obsidian at night without disturbing your sleep.
